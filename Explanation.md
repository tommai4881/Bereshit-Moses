# Textual Restoration and Liturgical Structure: An Exhaustive Comparative Analysis of LDS Book of Moses (Moses 2–8) and the Bereshit Parashah (Genesis 1:1–6:8)
By Mai Lê Bảo Khang (baokhang48812002@gmail.com)

## I. Introduction: Defining the Textual and Liturgical Context
The structural relationship between the Latter-day Saint (LDS) Book of Moses (chapters 2 through 8) and the foundational Jewish Torah portion, *Parashat Bereshit*, is one of striking isomorphism. *Bereshit* (“In the Beginning”), comprising Genesis 1:1 through 6:8, is the first segment in the annual Jewish cycle of Torah readings.1 This parashah narrates the primordial history: the six days of Creation, the placement and subsequent expulsion of Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden, the tragedy of Cain and Abel, the genealogies of the antediluvian world, and the escalating wickedness that prompts God’s decision to flood the earth. Liturgically, *Bereshit* is read on the first Sabbath immediately following *Simchat Torah*, the celebration marking the conclusion and immediate restart of the Torah reading cycle.

The LDS Book of Moses, conversely, is an extract taken from the initial phase of Joseph Smith’s revelatory “New Translation” (JST) of the Bible, undertaken beginning in June 1830, shortly after the formal organization of the Church. This translation effort was rooted in the stated purpose of restoring "precious things" and key doctrinal truths believed to have been lost or removed from the biblical text over time. The Book of Moses, spanning eight chapters, corresponds to Genesis 1:1 through 6:13 in the King James Version (KJV).

The central analytical thesis of this report confirms the remarkable fidelity of the Book of Moses’s chapter divisions to the boundaries of the seven traditional *aliyot* (sections) of *Bereshit* (Genesis 1:1–6:8). The structural congruence suggests that while the LDS text is viewed as a divinely inspired *restoration and expansion*, the foundational narrative framework of the Masoretic Text’s primeval history remains the organizing principle for the revealed content. The resulting document is not a complete departure from Genesis but rather a dramatic augmentation of the narrative, necessitated by the inclusion of expansive doctrines regarding cosmology, the pre-mortal existence, and the covenantal administration of the Gospel to the earliest prophets.

The investigation will proceed by first establishing the precise structural parallelism, accounting for the unique visionary prelude (Moses 1) and the brief, yet significant, narrative extension beyond the traditional Bereshit boundary. Subsequently, the report will analyze the profound theological implications introduced by the massive content expansion within the confines of these pre-existing canonical divisions.

## II. The Structural Congruence: Mapping Aliyot Boundaries and Narrative Flow
The organization of *Parashat Bereshit* into seven *aliyot* (readings) provides a standardized structure for the reading of the Torah on the Sabbath. These divisions serve as thematic markers for the primeval history. The Book of Moses adheres to these traditional divisions almost without deviation from Moses 2:1 through Moses 8:27a, demonstrating that the restoration occurred within an accepted, if not ancient, structural sequence.

### II.A. The Visionary Prelude: Moses 1 (The Non-Canonical Framing Device)
The Book of Moses begins with a crucial chapter, Moses 1, that has no parallel in the Masoretic Text of Genesis. This chapter, which was the first revelation received for the New Translation in June 1830, is titled the "Visions of Moses" and acts as a definitive preface to the book of Genesis.

The content of Moses 1 is twofold: it provides a profound theophany in which Moses sees the scope of God’s creation and his own prophetic role, and it details a direct confrontation with Satan, who attempts to deceive Moses immediately following his revelatory experience. The inclusion of this initial vision establishes an irrefutable epistemological claim regarding the source of the subsequent Genesis account. In a world where academic source criticism (like the Documentary Hypothesis) challenges the notion of Mosaic authorship, the Book of Moses opens by validating Moses's authority to write the subsequent account through a **direct, divine commission and vision.** This structural framing device positions the ensuing narrative not merely as history compiled from oral or written traditions, but as an immediate, firsthand revealed record. The vision serves to authenticate the entire text as a document derived from the prophetic experience of Moses himself, thereby fundamentally refuting the premises of critical analysis that doubt the Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch.6
### II.B. The Precise Alignment of Aliyot 1 through 7
The verse breaks employed in the Book of Moses chapters 2 through 8 align with remarkable precision to the traditional liturgical divisions of Genesis 1:1 through 6:8.3 This congruence indicates that the revelatory expansion was not arbitrary but utilized the existing KJV structure—which necessarily follows the Masoretic Text's natural narrative breaks—as a scaffold for inserting the restored content.

The First Aliyah (Moses 2:1–3:3) matches Genesis 1:1–2:3, concluding precisely with God’s sanctification of the Sabbath after the six days of creation.3 This segment, corresponding to the scholarly "Priestly" (P) source, is maintained as a cohesive unit. The Second Aliyah (Moses 3:4–19), covering Genesis 2:4–19, introduces the subsequent, more detailed creation narrative, ending just before the creation of Eve. The Third Aliyah (Moses 3:20–4:27), covering Genesis 2:20–3:21, is perhaps the most doctrinally dense segment, detailing the creation of Eve, the temptation, the Fall, and the expulsion. Despite this narrative segment being greatly expanded by the insertion of the extensive Council in Heaven narrative in Moses 4 10, the concluding verse break remains fixed at the canonical end of Genesis 3:21.

This rigorous adherence continues through the Fourth Aliyah (Moses 4:28–5:43), dealing with the post-Eden life and the story of Cain and Abel; the Fifth Aliyah (Moses 5:44–46), dealing with the brief lineage of Cain; and the Sixth Aliyah (Moses 5:47–8:1), which dramatically expands the genealogies of Seth and includes the full, expansive history of Enoch’s ministry and the translation of Zion (Moses 6 and 7). Finally, the Seventh Aliyah and Maftir (Moses 8:2–27a) conclude the liturgical portion, matching Genesis 5:25–6:8, and detailing the increasing corruption of mankind leading to God’s grief.

The following table provides a clear structural comparison:

#### Structural Mapping of Bereshit Parashah Aliyot to the Book of Moses (JST) Chapters
| Bereshit Aliyah (Torah Reading)|Genesis Verses (Masoretic/KJV)|Book of Moses Alignment (Chapters/Verses)|Key Content Distinction|
|-|-|-|-|
|PRELUDE (Non-Canonical)|N/A|Moses 1:1–42|Vision of Creation, confrontation with Satan, establishment of Moses’s commission.
|1st Reading (Rishon)|Genesis 1:1–2:3|Moses 2:1 – 3:3|Integration of spiritual creation; Christ identified as the Creator.
|2nd Reading (Sheni)|Genesis 2:4–19|Moses 3:4–19|Focus on physical creation logistics and preparation of Eden.
|3rd Reading (Shlishi)|Genesis 2:20 – 3:21|Moses 3:20 – 4:27|Detailed account of the pre-mortal conflict (Council in Heaven); Satan’s motivation.|
|4th Reading (Revi'i)|Genesis 3:22 – 4:18|Moses 4:28 – 5:43|Adam and Eve receive explicit covenant instruction (Gospel) post-Fall.|
|5th Reading (Chamishi)|Genesis 4:19–22|Moses 5:44–46|Lineage of Cain and the beginnings of secret combinations.|
|6th Reading (Shishi)|Genesis 4:23 – 5:24|Moses 5:47 – 8:1|Extensive chapters on Enoch’s vision, preaching, and the translation of Zion (Moses 6 & 7).|
|7th Reading (Shevi'i)|Genesis 5:25 – 6:4|Moses 8:2–21|Noah's ministry and the rise of widespread violence and wickedness.11|
|MAFTIR / EXTENSION|Genesis 6:5–13|Moses 8:22–30|Conclusion of the historical account, specifying Noah’s righteousness and the covenant to preserve him.|

### II.C. The Canonical Overlap: Extending into Parashat Noach
A final crucial structural point is the extension of the Book of Moses beyond the liturgical boundary of *Bereshit*. While *Bereshit* concludes at Genesis 6:8, the Book of Moses continues to Moses 8:30, encompassing Genesis 6:9–13. These five verses constitute the beginning of the next weekly Torah portion, *Parashat Noach*.

If the objective of the revelation was strictly to adhere to the existing canonical chapter divisions, the text would have ceased at Moses 8:27a (Genesis 6:8). The continuation demonstrates a prioritization of **narrative integrity and thematic completion** over strict adherence to liturgical segmentation. Genesis 6:9-13 is vital because it establishes Noah’s covenantal righteousness ("a just man, perfect in his generations") and provides the formal introduction to the impending Flood narrative (God’s decision to destroy the earth, detailed in 6:13).11 By extending to Genesis 6:13, the revealed text provides a stable, conclusive break for the first portion of the JST, finishing the detailed account of the primeval world's destruction and establishing the protagonist for the new beginning. This structural choice suggests that the scope of the JST revelation for Genesis 1–6 was defined by the natural, comprehensive narrative arc of the world prior to the Deluge.

## III. Theological Divergence: Expansion and Restoration of "Precious Things"
The structural alignment confirms where the revelation occurred; the textual expansion dictates what was restored. The Book of Moses is not merely a restatement of Genesis; it introduces several complex, foundational LDS doctrines that necessitate the extensive textual growth observed across its chapters.
### III.A. Cosmology: Reconciling Creation Narratives and the JEDP Challenge
Modern biblical scholarship utilizes the Documentary Hypothesis (DH) to suggest that the Pentateuch, including Genesis, is a composite text drawn from multiple, disparate sources (Jahwist, Elohist, Priestly, Deuteronomist) compiled centuries after Moses.14 Critics note the use of distinct divine names (Elohim in Genesis 1:1–2:3, Yahweh/Jehovah in Genesis 2:4 onward) and seemingly distinct creation accounts as evidence of source fragmentation.

The Book of Moses offers a unified and cohesive interpretation that addresses the perceived discrepancies in creation accounts through the doctrine of spiritual creation. Moses 2:5 (Aliyah 1) states explicitly that God created all things "spiritually, before they were naturally upon the face of the earth".12 This revelatory insertion provides a theological key for harmonizing the two accounts: Genesis 1 (the P source, according to DH) describes the spiritual organization and blueprint, while Genesis 2 (the J source) describes the subsequent physical formation of Adam and the earthly environment. The Book of Moses therefore transforms what modern scholars view as accidental source juxtaposition into a systematic, intended sequence of creative events (spiritual first, then physical) under the direction of Christ.12 The unified narrative thus stands as a direct challenge to the fragmentation model of the DH, asserting a cohesive, chronologically accurate Mosaic record.
### III.B. The Fall and the Council in Heaven (Moses 4)
The Book of Moses profoundly alters the significance of the Fall by providing detailed context regarding the pre-mortal existence and the purpose of mortality. Where Genesis 3 presents the serpent as merely a subtle creature (Gen 3:1), Moses 4 (Aliyah 3) inserts the explicit narrative of the Council in Heaven. It identifies the serpent as Lucifer (Satan), detailing his motives for rebellion: seeking to destroy the agency of man and usurp God's power.

This doctrinal expansion elevates the principle of **moral agency** to an eternal, foundational tenet. The resulting conflict is not merely about an apple, but about the right of humanity to choose. The text explains that those who opposed God's plan and sought to destroy agency ultimately lost their own. Consequently, the Fall of Adam and Eve is reinterpreted within the context of eternal progression; it becomes a necessary and anticipated event, designed to allow the knowledge of good and evil to facilitate mortal experience and the subsequent introduction of the Redeemer. This reframing of Genesis 3 is critical to LDS soteriology, fundamentally redefining the nature of sin and the necessity of Christ’s atonement.
### III.C. The Establishment of the Gospel from Adam (Moses 5–7)
Perhaps the most extensive doctrinal expansion occurs within Aliyah 4 and Aliyah 6, covering Moses chapters 5 through 7. Genesis 4 and 5 primarily recount genealogies and the increasing wickedness of mankind. The Book of Moses, however, restores the doctrine that the **full Gospel of Jesus Christ** was administered through explicit covenant and ordinances from Adam’s time onward.

Moses 5 details that Adam and Eve were taught the principle of sacrifice, and upon inquiring, were instructed that this ordinance was "a similitude of the sacrifice of the Only Begotten Son". Furthermore, Adam was taught repentance, baptism by immersion, and the reception of the Holy Ghost—explicit elements of the Christian covenant usually associated only with the New Testament dispensation. This assertion that the ancient prophets received the fullness of Christ’s doctrine fundamentally contradicts critical theories of religious development which suggest that Hebrew religion evolved over millennia, slowly adding theological complexity. The Book of Moses posits that the Gospel, as a unified system, was established at the commencement of human history.

The narrative of Enoch’s ministry (Moses 6 and 7, within Aliyah 6) provides the scriptural archetype for this successful early administration of the Gospel. Expanding dramatically on Genesis 5:24 ("Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him"), Moses details Enoch’s visions of the Millennium and Christ’s future Atonement, his successful preaching of righteousness, and the ultimate translation of his entire city, Zion.17 This segment provides tangible evidence of the profound spiritual achievements of the ancient world that rivals, and perhaps surpasses, modern religious achievements.

The following comparative table summarizes the most significant doctrinal augmentations achieved within the structure of the **Bereshit** narrative:

#### Comparative Doctrinal Focus: Genesis 1–6 (KJV) vs. Moses 1–8 (LDS)
|Thematic Concept|Genesis (KJV)|Book of Moses (LDS)|Doctrinal Purpose of Expansion|
|-|-|-|-|
Authoritative Basis|Implicit Mosaic history; compilation (DH).|Moses 1: Visionary revelation, establishing prophetic authority and combating skepticism.|Securing the text's inspired and literal Mosaic origin against source criticism.|
|Creation Method|Two juxtaposed accounts (Gen 1: P; Gen 2: J).|Doctrine of prior "spiritual creation" (Moses 2:5, 3:5), unifying the Genesis 1 and 2 accounts.|Harmonizing apparent textual discrepancies and defining God’s creative methodology.|
|Satan/The Fall|Serpent is "subtle" (Gen 3:1). Motivation is implicit.|Detailed Council in Heaven, identifies Lucifer, clarifies the struggle over human agency (Moses 4:1-4).|Establishes the existence of pre-mortal life and the eternal law of agency.|
|The Priesthood/Gospel|Implied necessity of sacrifice (Gen 4); no explicit plan.|Explicitly taught to Adam, requires baptism, Holy Ghost, and centers entirely on the Son (Moses 5:6-12).|Establishes the "ancient nature of the Gospel," ensuring prophets beginning with Adam had the fullness of Christ's doctrine.|
|Enoch's Biography|Walks with God; is taken (Gen 5:24).|Detailed visions of the Millennium, Christ's atonement, Enoch’s successful ministry, and the city of Zion's translation (Moses 6-7).|Provides the scriptural archetype of collective salvation and prophetic success.|
# IV. Historical and Source Critical Implications: Antiquity vs. Restoration
The emergence of the Book of Moses in 1830 coincided with the rise of historical-critical methods in biblical scholarship, which often questioned traditional authorship claims. The Book of Moses’s relationship to antiquity and modern criticism is complex, requiring engagement with both the Documentary Hypothesis (DH) and ancient literary parallels.

## IV.A. The Challenge to the Documentary Hypothesis
The JST was revealed during a period when scholars like Jean Astruc and later Julius Wellhausen were advancing theories that the Pentateuch was compiled from various independent documents, arguing against the historical validity of Mosaic authorship.

The doctrinal assertion in the Book of Moses that God commanded Moses to write the record 6 and its subsequent claim to restore content that was "taken" from the original text 4 functions as a direct, theological challenge to the DH. If, as the JST posits, the text was given to Moses in vision and subsequently corrupted during transmission (losing plain and precious things), then the inconsistencies identified by critics—such as the two creation accounts or differing divine names—are evidence not of disparate sources, but of post-Mosaic textual entropy. The structure of the Book of Moses, therefore, presents a revelatory model wherein the text must be restored to its pre-corrupted, unified Mosaic form, thereby validating the historical reality of the ancient prophet and his sacred writings.

## IV.B. Ancient Literary Affinities (Pseudepigrapha and Brass Plates)
The extensive expansions found in Moses 1, 6, and 7 exhibit striking thematic parallels with Jewish literature from the Intertestamental Period, often classified as Pseudepigrapha (e.g., the Book of Enoch, Jubilees).17 These writings also elaborate on the primeval history encompassed by *Bereshit*. For instance, the Book of Jubilees also features the instruction for Moses to record what he sees in vision, echoing the framing device of Moses 1.

The Enoch sections in Moses 6–7, in particular, provide detail on Enoch’s preaching, his translation, and his visionary experiences that resonate strongly with the Ethiopic Book of Enoch. While some critical views suggest Joseph Smith may have inadvertently or deliberately drawn from contemporary knowledge of these expanded traditions, many scholars observe that the Book of Moses integrates these expanded narratives into a contextually and doctrinally sophisticated system that exceeds known ancient or contemporary sources.

Specifically, the Book of Moses synthesizes the detailed narrative traditions regarding Creation, the Fall, and Enoch’s ministry with an explicit, unified Christological framework—the Gospel preached to Adam 6—and a foundational doctrine of agency (Moses 4). This synthesis argues for the text being drawn from a "common well of ancient textual and oral traditions" that precedes the known compilation of the Masoretic Text or even the New Testament era.18 The existence of these ancient affinities, integrated coherently within the *Bereshit* framework, strengthens the claim that the Book of Moses reflects a deeply rooted, ancient understanding of the primeval history that was subsequently lost to the canonical tradition.

## V. Conclusion: Synthesis and Significance of the Structural Blueprint

The relationship between the LDS Book of Moses (chapters 2–8) and the Jewish Parashat Bereshit (Genesis 1:1–6:8) is one defined by precise structural adoption coupled with profound theological redefinition. The structural congruence demonstrates that the JST adhered meticulously to the thematic and narrative boundaries established by the seven traditional aliyot of the Torah portion, utilizing this blueprint as a necessary scaffold. This adherence ensured that the restored text maintained a connection to the recognizable canonical narrative of Genesis.

However, the Book of Moses is definitively a restored covenant blueprint rather than a simple retelling. By incorporating the visionary prologue (Moses 1) and the final narrative completion (extending to Genesis 6:13, the start of Noach), the revelation prioritizes narrative and theological unity over strict observance of subsequent liturgical boundaries. The resulting text fundamentally shifts the understanding of the primeval history by:

1. **Establishing Epistemological Authority**: Anchoring the narrative in the direct, personal vision and command received by Moses, thereby preemptively neutralizing source-critical challenges to Mosaic authorship.
2. **Harmonizing Cosmology**: Introducing the doctrine of spiritual creation to systematically reconcile the two seemingly disparate creation accounts of Genesis 1 and 2.
3. **Refining Soteriology**: Elevating the Fall to a necessary, planned event preceded by a pre-mortal conflict over human agency, thereby clarifying the universal and eternal nature of the Plan of Salvation.
4. **Confirming Historical Continuity**: Asserting that the fullness of the Gospel of Jesus Christ was taught to Adam and maintained by antediluvian prophets like Enoch, thereby refuting theories that suggest an evolutionary development of covenant theology.

In sum, the LDS Book of Moses, revealed within the established framework of the *Bereshit* parashah, serves as a comprehensive restoration of "plain and precious things", presenting a unified, Christ-centered, and expansive narrative of the beginnings of human history and the eternal workings of God's covenant with mankind.
