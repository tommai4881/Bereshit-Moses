# A Tale of Two Texts: An Exhaustive Comparative Analysis of the LDS Book of Moses and the Torah Portion Bereshit

This project presents a visual comparison of the LDS Book of Moses and the Torah Portion Bereshit, exploring the direct structural relationship, quantitative differences, and unique elements of these two accounts of creation and early humanity. It is based on the textual analysis found in [Explanation.md](Explanation.md).

## Key Findings

The central analytical thesis of this report confirms the remarkable fidelity of the Book of Moses’s chapter divisions to the boundaries of the seven traditional *aliyot* (sections) of *Bereshit* (Genesis 1:1–6:8). The structural congruence suggests that while the LDS text is viewed as a divinely inspired *restoration and expansion*, the foundational narrative framework of the Masoretic Text’s primeval history remains the organizing principle for the revealed content.
